## 👀 What is it about?
Let's get into the use of style sheets. Ready to learn and stimulate your imagination?
Anyone can participate, the idea is to share the process.

## 🤔 How can I participate?
You don't have to be a CSS expert, the idea is to learn.

🟣 To begin, we are going to document ourselves about the properties that will be most useful. I recommend looking for:
* background
* clip-path
* box-shadow
* border

🟣 Some resources to get fully into the subject:
* [Drawing with CSS Gradient](https://css-tricks.com/drawing-images-with-css-gradients/)
* [Sigle div drawings](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/09/single-div-drawings-with-css/)
* [Basic guide to create images with CSS](https://medium.com/coding-artist/a-beginners-guide-to-pure-css-images-ef9a5d069dd2)

🟣 Read the resources, then choose an object that represents you and start drawing it with CSS. Choose the technique that you want. It can be realistic, cartoon, etc.

✨**OPTIONAL**: Add some interaction with JS.

## 🎨 Can I add my picture in the gallery?
Sure! You have two ways to send us your art:
1. Open an **issue** in this repository, select the template `Solicitud de adición de arte a galería` and fill in the information.
2. **Make a tweet with the hashtag #DibujarteCSS** and tag to @musartedev
